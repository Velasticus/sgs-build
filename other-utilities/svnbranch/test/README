To run the full test suite, do:

  ./testclean
  ./testinit
  ./testall

Each separate test in each of the test files assumes the following
preconditions for subversion trunks and branches:

- $branch, $branch_copy, $branch2, $trunk, and $trunk_copy contain no
  modifications
- $branch, $branch2, and $trunk do not need updating (the copies might)
- $trunk and $branch contain the directory 'dir', and the files
  'file.txt' and 'file2.txt'
- The file 'file.txt' is only changed in $trunk
- The file 'file2.txt' is only changed in $branch
- $branch is refreshed up to date from $trunk
