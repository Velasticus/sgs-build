<h1>Subversion Branch Management Utilities</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The svnbranch subdirectory consists of utilities for merging changes
between <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> branches
and their associated trunks.  The utilities, which are written in <a
href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>, are intended to simplify the
process of performing Subversion merge commands to move changes between
a branch and a trunk, to maintain information about the merges
performed, and to provide warnings when files have been moved. <p>

While Subversion provides some support for branching, that support, at
least as of version 1.4, is limited in several ways:

<ul>
  <li> There is no automatic support for keeping track of the revisions
       merged between the branch and the trunk.  Users need to keep
       track of this information by recording the revision information
       in log comments, and using that information to help them
       determine what revisions to compare for subsequent merges.

  <li> There is no error checking to ensure that merges are applied in
       the right places, or that branches have been updated to reflect
       changes in the trunk before their changes are merged back.

  <li> Merges that involve files that have been moved in the branch or
       the trunk can cause changes to those files to be silently
       ignored.
</ul> <p>

This project provides two utilities, one for ensuring that a branch
includes changes made in the associated trunk, and another for pushing
changes made in a branch up into the trunk:

<ul>
  <li> The <b><code>svnrefresh</code></b> command "refreshes" the
       working copy for a branch in the current directory by merging
       changes into it made in the trunk since the branch was created or
       last refreshed. <p>

  <li> The <b><code>svnmergeup</code></b> command merges changes up into
       the working copy for a trunk in the current directory made in an
       associated branch.
</ul> <p>

For both commands, you need a working copy to accept the changes.  The
commands merge the changes into that working copy, but leave the changes
uncommitted.  You can perform tests in the modified working copy to
ensure that the merge was successful prior to committing the changes.
Both commands accept an argument that specifies the source of the
changes to be merged.  That argument can either specify the URL of the
Subversion repository that contains the branch or trunk, or can be the
pathname of a working copy. <p>

<h2>Example</h2>

Here is a simple example for how you might use these commands to manage
a Subversion branch:

<ul>
  <li> Create the branch using the Subversion copy command:
<pre>
$ svn copy -m "Create branch mybranch" svn://labsvn/sgs/trunk svn://labsvn/sgs/branches/mybranch
</pre> <p>
    
  <li> Create a working copy for the branch:

<pre>
$ svn checkout svn://labsvn/sgs/branches/mybranch ~/svn/sgs-mybranch
</pre> <p>

  <li> Modify the branch, committing changes as desired. <p>

  <li> When you want to get recent changes from the trunk, first commit
       outstanding changes in the branch.  Before getting the changes,
       you may want to check to see what will be refreshed:

<pre>
$ cd ~/svn/sgs-mybranch
$ svnrefresh -n
</pre>

	You can add the <code>-v</code> option to see the diffs and log
	for the changes to be applied. <p>

  <li> Next refresh the branch with the changes by leaving out
       the <code>-n</code> option:

<pre>
$ cd ~/svn/sgs-mybranch
$ svnrefresh
</pre> <p>

  <li> When you've checked the refreshed changes over, commit them to
       the branch:
<pre>
$ svn commit -m "Refresh revision 1234"
</pre> <p>

  <li> Make more changes, refresh, and commit as desired, until you are
       ready to merge your changes up to the trunk. <p>

  <li> Create a working copy for the trunk:
<pre>
$ svn checkout svn://labsvn/sgs/trunk ~/svn/sgs
</pre> <p>

  <li> You can check to see what changes will be merged up first:

<pre>
$ cd ~/svn/sgs
$ svnmergeup -n ~/svn/sgs-mybranch
</pre> <p>

  <li> Merge the changes up by leaving out the <code>-n</code> option:

<pre>
$ cd ~/svn/sgs
$ svnmergeup ~/svn/sgs-mybranch
</pre> <p>

  <li> Commit the changes when you are satisfied with them:

<pre>
$ svn commit -m "Merge up revision 1236 of branch mybranch"
</pre>

</ul> <p>

If the <code>svnrefresh</code> or <code>svnmergeup</code> commands
detect that the changes involve moving files, they will print a message
describing the changes detected.  You should perform any moves needed by
hand, and then use the <code>-f</code> option to apply the changes to
the modified working copy. <p>

If you have already performed merges between branches and trunks without
using the svnrefresh and svnmergeup commands, you can use
the <code>-i</code> option to the <code>svnrefresh</code>
and <code>svnmergeup</code> commands to make modifications to working
copies that will record what revisions have been refreshed and merged up
already. <p>

Both commands will print help messages if the <code>-h</code> option is
specified. <p>

<h2>Requirements and Limitations</h2>

<ul>
  <li> The <code>svn</code> command must be available in your shell's
       path or in the directory specified by the <code>SVNDIR</code>
       environment variable.

  <li> Merges must be performed from the top level directory of the
       branch or trunk, and update the entire directory.

  <li> Branches must be refreshed before they are merged up into the
       trunk.

  <li> Trunk directories must end in <code>/trunk</code>, branch
       directories must end in <code>/branches/<i>branchname</i></code>.

  <li> If a working copy is specified for the source of a merge, that
       working copy must be up to date with the repository and must not
       be modified.

  <li> The <code>-f</code> option must be specified to permit merges
       into a modified working copy.

  <li> The algorithm for identifying moved files is conservative and may
       include moves that have no effect on the merge.

  <li> Branches must hang off of the trunk &mdash; hierarchical branching is
       not (currently) supported.

  <li> Use the <code>-i</code> option to the <code>svnmerge</code>
       command to record information about a branch merged into the
       trunk if you rename the branch directory.

  <li> Only repository URLs with the <code>svn</code> and
      <code>file</code> URL schemes have been tested.
</ul> <p>
